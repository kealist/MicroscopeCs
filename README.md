# MicroscopeCs

This is a C# implementation of the Microscope RPG based as a Class Library.  The initial game will be available in a WinForm version that should build with Visual Studio or Mono.  Later I will add a web interface.

## Requirements
Currently to build and run the project, you will need a database install.  The current connection uses EntityFramework and is connected through SQL Express 2016.  SQLite is another less invasive option.
